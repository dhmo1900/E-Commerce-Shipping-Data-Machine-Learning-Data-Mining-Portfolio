# The Importance of the E-commerce Shipping Dataset #
                                                                
E-Commerce plays a significant role in our world nowadays. Companies like Amazon, Noon, and Food deliveries such as Talabat and Delivero face different challenges every day to provide the best customer service and to deliver the shipments and items on time and improve the customer rating at the same time. 

Some Questions we need to answer like the following:
Was the shipment delivered on time or not?
If Product importance or the number of customer care calls are high, the item will be delivered on time?
What is the Customer rating? 

Other interesting findings will be discovered with the below analysis and exploration of the data.
